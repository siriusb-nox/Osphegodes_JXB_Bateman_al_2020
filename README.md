Supporting material of "Whole plastomes are not enough: phylogenomic and morphometric exploration at multiple demographic levels of the bee orchid clade Ophrys sect. Sphegodes" by Bateman et al.

This repositroy provides the wole plastid genome alignment used to infer ML phylogenies and networks, as well as the plastid' covariance matrix derived from plastid Genotype Likelihoods.
